## SOP for Generation of JAXids

To use *JAXid generator app*, there are simple steps:

1. Go to [JAXid batch generator](https://ctweinstock02/jaxid_generator/batch)
    a. Enter the number of IDs you plan to use (e.g. 50, 5000)
    a. Hit the *button*.
    a. This will download an *xlsx* file containing all the new *JAXid*s,
     along with the other columns that are related to each id,
     (e.g. Project Code, Collaborator ID)

1. Open that excel doc and combine that first column with the *JAXid*s with
    your own pre-prepared spreadsheet of all the other data
    (i.e. Project code, collaborator id, etc)

1. Log in to the '*admin*' section:
    a. [JAXid generator admin](https://ctweinstock02/jaxid_generator/admin/)
    a. From the main list, click on '*Jax id details*'
    a. When that page comes up, click the button in upper right '*Import*'
    a. Select the file, select the file type '*xlsx*', press *Submit*.
    a. Please ***Review*** the results of the proposed import,
     checking for *inserts* and *updates* then click '*Confirm Import*'

1. **Log out**! (for security reasons)
